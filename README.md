  Pomodoro timer for time management.

## Usage
  https://java-hater.github.io/pomodoro-timer/
As per the Pomodoro Technique described below, the timer is split into three tasks: Pomodoro (or 'Focus'), Short Break, and Long Break. For ease of use, there is also a counter for the number of short breaks since the last long break. When you have completed your fourth short break, take a long break, and the counter will reset. At the end of each timer, a chime will play.

## Process
The Pomodoro Technique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a technique characterized by four repetitions of a 25 minute focus time followed by a 5 minute break time. At the end of four repetitions, a 20 minute break follows before repeating the central loop.

I chose not to have the timer automatically move from timer to timer in accordance with this technique, as its use case is more convenient with manual selection of timers (i.e. sometimes you want to take an extra short break, an early long break, etc)
