# pomodoro-timer
The Pomodoro Technique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a technique characterized by four repetitions of a 25 minute focus time followed by a 5 minute break time. At the end of four repetitions, a 20 minute break follows before repeating the central loop.
I chose not to have the timer automatically move from timer to timer in accordance with this technique, as its use case is more convenient with manual input.
